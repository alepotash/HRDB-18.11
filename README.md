# HR Employee Attrition Analysis

In this project, we explored a dataset that includes various attributes
related to employee satisfaction, performance, demographics, and job characteristics.

We used Python to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data, aiming
to uncover patterns and insights that can help HR managers make informed
decisions.

# We analyzed 5 main KPIs:
1. Attrition Trends and Patterns
2. Compensation and Benefits Analysis
3. Work-Life Balance and Satisfaction
4. Career Growth and Job Stability
5. Performance and Attrition
